# Get Next Line

## Project Overview

The "Get Next Line" project is a C programming exercise aimed at implementing a function that reads lines from a file descriptor. This function, `get_next_line`, facilitates reading text files line by line, providing a convenient solution for file parsing and processing tasks.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Line Reading**: `get_next_line` reads lines from a file descriptor, allowing for efficient handling of large text files without loading the entire file into memory.
- **Error Handling**: The function returns `NULL` when there are no more lines to read or if an error occurs, ensuring robust error handling and graceful program termination.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with both file descriptors and standard input, offering versatility in input sources.
